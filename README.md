# Graph Theory

This repository has implementations of graphs in Python and in Rust.


## Python
### Contents
The following algorithms were implemented:
- BFS 
- DFS
- Dijkstra
- Hierholzer
- Floyd Warshall

### Execute
To get the dependecies:

    poetry install
    
To execute:

    poetry run python graph

## Rust
### Contents
The following algorithms were implemented in Rust:
- Tarjan
- Prim
- Topological Ordering

### Execute

    cargo run
    
## The doc folder

This was done as assignements for INE5413: Graph Theory, so all the pdfs talking about the implementation are present there alongside the .tex files
